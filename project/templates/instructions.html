        This service allows you to upload any image and receive a 1024x1024 PNG, 
        which is the recommended size for Xcode app icons. Simply go to the 
        <a href="{{ url_for('upload_image') }}">conversion page</a>, select your file, and click "Convert."
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the conversion is complete, you can preview the result and download it 
        directly. This PNG image will be perfectly sized and formatted for use in your 
        Xcode project without requiring any additional manual resizing or formatting.
